```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#clear all environment and session variables
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))

library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(caret)
library(DMwR)

```

## Reading data

* set working directory
```{r}
setwd('c:/Users/212629693/Documents/Personal/ds-classes/INSOFE_Batch35_7302c_CUTe_Team17')
```

### Load the data set

```{r}
train_data_orig <- read.csv('Datasets/train_data.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',', na.strings = "", numerals = "no.loss")

kable(summary(train_data_orig))

```

```{r}
kable(head(train_data_orig, 10))
```


###Observations:

* There're 109 regressors and 2 target variables (y1 and y2) and 1769 observations
* Data appears to already have been scaled and standardized. 
* There are a few empty columns (ie all )
* Some values are missing in other columns


## Preprocessing
### Empty Columns
### Handle NAs
### Normalization
### Create Train-Test split
## Understanding the Regressors
## Assessing fit for Timeseries Forecasting
## Initial Model
## Final Model
## Predictions
## Performance

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
kable(summary(cars))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
